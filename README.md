I found very little information on the Internet about displaying "Hello World" on a HDMI screen with an FPGA board (in my example, I am using a DE10-NANO).
So I decided to post this source online to show that it is possible. 
For those who would like to try this adventure, this project was realesed with Quartus Prime.

Good luck ! ;)
